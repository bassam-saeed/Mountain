#+TITLE: Fuji

* What is this?
Fuji is the "original" Mountain theme - the dark, neutral colorscheme that I set out to make in the first place. If you ever hear anyone say that they're using "Mountain Theme", chances are that older users will be referring to /this/. While I'm undergoing the shift to this more ambiguous design system, you'll find that this SKU will have far better support in terms of application themes.

* Design Parameters
Making Figma graphics takes time - heck, I don't even know how to use the software properly! Please bear with me as I navigate through the revamp/redesign :)
