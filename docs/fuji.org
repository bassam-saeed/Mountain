#+TITLE: Fuji

* What is this?
Fuji is the "original" Mountain theme - the dark, neutral colorscheme that I set out to make in the first place. If you ever hear anyone say that they're using "Mountain Theme", chances are that older users will be referring to /this/. While I'm undergoing the shift to this more ambiguous design system, you'll find that this SKU will have far better support in terms of application themes.

You'll also find that this theme is a lot more suitable for application themes than Hotaka (at the time of writing) - it's a lot more readable and stuff. Hotaka will /eventually/ be readable, but for now this is your best bet.

* Design Parameters
I've taken the liberty of making a couple of graphics that I thought would help visualize the different facets of Mountain's colors. As far as standards, there really isn't one - if you think you've made a cool theme that utilizes Fuji's primarily black/gray aesthetic and the Mountain colors, feel free to PR it! At the end of the day, how /you/ want to use these colors matters a whole lot more than the restrictions and guidelines I might implement :)
